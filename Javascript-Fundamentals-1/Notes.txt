command or ctrl+b ->to get rid of file manager in vs code

we explicitly call console of browser or developer tool by using cosole.log();

inline JavaScript is used by adding <script></script> in HTML file.

we can use <script src="file path"></script> to explicitly connect HTML file to JavaScript file. Which is better coding practice.
=====================================================================================================================
; (semicolon) at the end of each coding line is not mandatory but one should follow it for code readability.

variable name conventions -

follows camel case naming convention ->e.g. first, firstName, myFirstName.

Person,MyName,Address (NOt camel case naming convention)

$ and _ , numbers ,letter are allowed.
rest are not allowed while naming a variable.

variables should not start with Numbers as it will give syntax error.
it can start with $ or _ 

also for constat use upper case letters ->e.g. PI =3.14..





=====================================================================================================================
dynamic typing in javascript

code execution happens from top to bottom

values hold the data type not the variable name

variable name ust act as the container or box for whatever placed inside it.

there are 7 datatypes in javascript

number ->floating,decimal,intger
string ->sequence of characters
boolean ->true or false

undefined
null
symbol(ES2020) ->some constant
bigint ->for large number values.

null in javascript is an object(bug) ->value of null is null and datatype is object

undefined datatype is a variable with no value or empty box ->value is undefined and datatype is also undefined.
=====================================================================================================================

let,const,var

let ->block scoped, mutating variable
const->immutable, value once assigned as the declaration time is fixed thoughout the code
var ->function-scoped, mutating variable,legacy variable,not used now

declaring variable without using let,const,var is allowedin javascript but one should not follow it
as it will create a global scope ->creates a property on globel object.

Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
Â§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
m tall.
Â§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 
m tall.
GOOD LUCK ï¿½

string

"" can include '' but '' can not include the  "" . but both if used separately create a string only.

type coersion ->javascript converts a number into string and then concatenates with the rest of the string.

(ES6)template literals string -> write a string in more normal way then insert the variables directly into the string 
 -> `` ->most use ES6 feature->e.g. const js=`Hey ${varable_name} string`;

 `` ->backticks can be used as ust the regular string.
---------------------------------
 for new line \n\

 console.log('string \n\ hey \n\ hello')

 but with ``(template string) just hit enter to go to new line
 e.g.console.log(`hey
 hello
 lets go`)

 can be used to insert multiple html elements in javascript

=====================================================================================================================
taking decisions ->if/else

if-else is called control structure (gives programmer control regarding how code should work)
else is optional blockk
=====================================================================================================================
Challenge 2

Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

1. Print a nice output to the console, telling the user who has the higher BMI. The message can be either:

"Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!".

2. Modify the outputs above to use template literals to include the BMI values in the outputs.

Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" or "John's BMI (29.1) is higher than Mark's (27)!".

Note: Don't round the BMI values. Leave them as they are.

=====================================================================================================================
Type conversion and coersion

Type conversion when we manually convert one type to the other
  to convert a string value to number we use -> Number("")
  to convet the number value to stirng we use -> String ()


type coersion (implicitly) when javascript automatically converts the types

the + operator converts the Number to string implicitly in console.log (in 'Number',"",``) hence type coersion
the -,*,/ operator converts the String to Numbers implicitly in console.log (in 'Number',"",``) hence type coersion


to clear console click clear button in console. (ctrl+L);

coersion can sometimes be avoided while coding as it may make code less complicated to understand.
but sometime knowing coersion may help in writing less code.
=====================================================================================================================

truthy and falsy values

there are values in javascript which are not false but when try to convert them in boolean it will become false 
=>called falsy values
NaN(Not a number)

e.g. 0, '', undefined, null, NaN

other than these values all other values are truthy values as it will become true when we try to convert them
into boolean values

conversion to boolean values is always implicit i.e. type coersion.
e.g. using with logical operators and if-else statements
=====================================================================================================================

Equality Operators == & === for comparisions

===
->strict Equality operator
->does not perform type coersion returns true if both values are exactly true e.g. '18'===18 return false
->return a true or false value i.e. boolean value
->used for the comprarision purpose

==
->does type coersion e.g. '18'==18 return true

best practice to use === operator for comprarision

incase of if-else if only one statement is there then we do not need to use {} although we can use it.
---------------------

input 

to take input we use 
prompt("Enter the value");

->return a string value convert it into Number using Number() function.
---------------------
if else if block
if()
{

}
else if()
{

}
else if()
{

}
else
{

}

----------------

not equal != loose version & !== strict version 

!==
->strict Equality operator
->does not perform type coersion returns true if both values are not matching return true e.g. '12'!==18 return false
->return a true or false value i.e. boolean value
->used for the comprarision purpose

==
->does type coersion e.g. '18'!=18 return true

Challenger 3

There are two gymnastics teams: Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!

Your tasks:

1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data included below. The average score for Dolphins should be assigned to the scoreDolphins variable, and the average score of Koalas should be assigned to the scoreKoalas variable.

2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print to the console:

"Dolphins win the trophy" if Dolphins win, or

"Koalas win the trophy" if Koalas win, or

"Both win the trophy" if their average scores are equal.



TEST DATA: Dolphins scored 96, 108, and 89. Koalas scored 88, 91, and 110.

switch statement

->control structure
->does strict condition check with case value and switch value.
->switch case statemnet is an alternative to the if-else control structure

switch(){
  case 1:

    break; //to stop the flow of execution without break all statements will get executed

  case 2:

    break;
  
  case 3:

    break;
  
  default:
    //executed when all the other cases fail
    break;
}
=====================================================================================================================
statement vs expression

expression produces a value e.g. 3+4 ->value is expression too e.g. 1991

statements are like full sentences that transalate actions

e.g const = 3+4; is a statement

in template literal `` we can only insert expressions

=====================================================================================================================

The conditional ternary operator

syntax: condtion ? if true then execute this : else this will get executed

eg. if(23>18) ? console.log("greater than 18") : console.log("not greater");

operator always produces a values 

->it is not thougth as replacement of if-else
->for bigger blocks of code we use if-else but if we need to make quick decision using short code 
then ternary operator us best to use as it evaluates to expression which can be used as value as well.

CHALLENGE #4
Steven needs a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes to eat in a restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

Your tasks:

Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called tip for this. It's not allowed to use an if...else statement (if it's easier for you, you can start with an if...else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator).

Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip).

Example: The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25.

Note: Use the values of the bill and tip variables to construct this string. Don't hard-code them ðŸ™‚

TEST DATA: Test with different bill values: 275, 40, and 430

HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2

HINT 2: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 ðŸ˜‰
