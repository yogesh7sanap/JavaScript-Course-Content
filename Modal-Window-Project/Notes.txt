PROECT #2 MODAL WINDOW- 

A pop window which will blur the background.
closes when we click on ❌ or blur background or esc button on keyboard.

To disconnect the url which is running via nodejs we stop the terminal by ctrl+c

document.querySelector() =>will select only the first element of that class which gets matched.
document.querySelectorAll() =>this will select all the elements that gets matched.

After this a document.querySelectorAll() will create a nodeList of element and we can iterate over tham using loop
ust like arrays.


=================================================================================================================
Working with Classes-

document.querySelector('<select element>').classList.remove('<class name without .>') 
  to remove class from an selected element.
classList.add()
  to add class.
We can also search for a class using classList.

Using these functionality of javascript we can activate and deactivate certain fuctionalities in javascript.
=================================================================================================================
Handling 'esc' keypress event 

search for a class in a elmenet-

  keyboard events are global event as they do not happen on specific element.

  
  Hence we listen on the whole document.

  3 types of event in keyboard events-
    1- key press - event will occur till the time we are pressing the key 
    2- key down - whenever we press the key
    3- key up - whenver we move our finger above the pressed key 

**TIP
whenver an event happens we will have information about that event in the event handler function.

we can access the event info using a parameter passed to event handler function.

to access which key is press using key property of event object which we have passed to event 
handler function as parameter which contains all the events details.

keyboard event as global event hence we use addEventListerner on document object
